## For the reader

Below I go over a bunch of design problems/decisions while developing this dinotree library.

I've written this assuming the reader knows rust and its basic data structures like a Vec, what a [kdtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree),[sweep and prune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_and_prune) ,and [quad tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) are. 


The source code for this book is the repo [dinotree_report](https://github.com/tiby312/dinotree_report) on github.
